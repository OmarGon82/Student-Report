Student-Report
A program to check if a student exists in an array of objects. This is another team treehouse challenge. It is a program that takes input from a user and checks if that student exists in an array of objects. The program keeps asking for input until the user exits the program. If a student is not found then it will show a warning letting the user know that student is not in the directory. At the end of the program, all the students searched a displayed with their information.
